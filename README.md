Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis Project using dbt and snowflake!

### Introduction

In this project, we used Netflix movies and series data  and stored in Snowflake. By using DBT with Snowflake, we showed how businesses can leverage these tools to solve complex data problems. We explored data modeling and logging, which are essential aspects of DBT. Through this project, we built robust data pipelines. We optimized data transformation and modeling workflows, making them more efficient and effective for their organization's needs.
