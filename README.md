Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis Project using dbt and snowflake!

### Introduction

In this project, I used Netflix movies and series data  and stored in Snowflake. By using DBT with Snowflake, I showed how businesses can leverage these tools to solve complex data problems. I explored data modeling and logging, which are essential aspects of DBT. Through this project, I built robust data pipelines. I optimized data transformation and modeling workflows, making them more efficient and effective for their organization's needs.
